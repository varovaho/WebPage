                As a computer science student, I've developed a strong foundation in programming principles 
                and software engineering practices. My focus on backend development stems from my fascination 
                with how complex systems work behind the scenes. I enjoy the challenge of creating efficient, 
                scalable solutions that can handle real-world demands.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Through academic projects and self-directed learning, I've gained hands-on experience with 
                Java ecosystem, database management, and modern development practices. I'm constantly 
                exploring new technologies and methodologies to stay current with industry trends.
